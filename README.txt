EMIT Hackathon 2

Todo:
    Add All option to Band combo boxes (What will Waterfall do in this case?)
    Upgrade pyaedt version, ignore lockfiles, update import paths
    Launch GUI from the automation tab in AEDT
    Figure out why Jason's runs are so much faster. Eldon and I get the ToAEDTProfile messages, he doesn't.
